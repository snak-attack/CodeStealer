#ComputerCraftScripts

Here you can find a list of scripts which you can download from pastebin. They are easy to use and fill various purposes.

##CodeStealer
A quick easy way to nastily take your friends' secret programs. This way you can hack their passwords, find out their coding secrets, etc.

###How to use
This program is typically installed on a floppy drive. 

Usually, you will insert the disk into the computer's disk drive. Upon insertion of the floppy, hit CTRL+R, you will be greeted with an evil nasty screen to steal the computer's data. Simply press S, wait for the operation to complete, then run off with your newly filled floppy disk.

Then, get back to your own computer. Use the same procedure but press T to download the files. Also you can press E to empty the disk.

Currently this steals files from ROOT, but I need to make sure it can steal directories too.

###Download

Type in the following 2 lines in the shell:

`pastebin get ibStShpB CS_2.0_install`

`CS_2.0_install`
